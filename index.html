I need to see the current file content first to make the precise changes. Could you provide the current content of the index.html file, or would you like me to fetch it? Since I need to preserve everything except lines 155-156, I should retrieve the file first to ensure accuracy.

Alternatively, if you have the complete updated file content ready, please provide it and I can push it directly.
